<img class=icon src="imgs/study.png">In the past twenty years, numerous publications and pedagogical studies have presented several breakdowns about why simulations ought to be put to use in business school classrooms.

Business simulations can easily seize a student's attention, forming more appealing and fascinating instruction adventures compared to, say, conventional, classroom-PowerPoint-based instruction.

<b>Students can learn and train on the goâ€¦</b>
<img class=icon src="imgs/training.png">Many simulation approaches are currently smartphone-compatible. Today's generation is an information-on-demand age bracket, and the reality that simulation-based instruction can be offered on several operating systems makes it workable for students to connect to knowledge and exercise activities when they want and in a format that correctly matches their tech style.

<b>How is business simulation-based education distinct from more standard approaches?</b>
<img class=icon src="imgs/difference.png">- Attract way more intensity among college students than conventional lectures or case analyses do.
- Generates risk-free practice atmospheres, where errors are studying opportunities instead of hidden tragedies. 
- Participate in jobs that are not only about digesting and studying, but also entail role-making judgments where folks can observe the results of their choices and match them up with other gamer's result.

<b>How do learners respond to working with simulations?</b>
<img class=icon src="imgs/avatar.jpg">"The experience we had with [Simul] simulations provided both learning and joy at the same time. We learnt because our students had theopportunity of dealing simultaneously with a group of basic variables which simulate daily business reality. ."

<img class=icon src="imgs/benefit.png">- Recall vocabulary.
- Learn fundamental business principles and standards.
- Understand the correlations between different business activities eg.advertising, money management, sales, etc. 
- Make challenging business theories, which may seem fairly simple, clearer. 
- Help students create business plans and assist learners in effectively implementing them after graduation. 
- Support folks in passing on what they learned into the business arena.</div>
